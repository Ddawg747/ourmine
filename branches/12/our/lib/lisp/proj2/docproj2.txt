Two discretization method where used for performing the experiments: Equal Interval Width (10 bins) and k-means. Both method fall under the unsupervized discretization however equal bin length is a global techinque which replaces each value by the identifier of the bin. The k-means is a local discretization tools which groups the data into a number of clusters based on some similarity measure. Equal Interval width is dividing the range of each column in ten equal bins and k means is grouping the rows in k different clusters using the Eucledian distance as a measure of similarity between the instances. In both cases the data is preprocessed by taking the log of each numeric value.
Since our main learning algorithm is Naive-Bayes, both discretization method greatly improve the performance of the learner. Naive-Bayes is used with both k-means clustering and equal interval frequency bins on each of the datasets.
