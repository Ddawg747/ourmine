It may seem unfair to consider an algorithm that in many ways, cheats. While most classifiers are burdened with the task of predicting for a single class, it is possible for our algorithm to return all possible classes and claim full accuracy. While we will demonstrate that this is rarely the case, it stands to reason that comparisions cannot be made between the accuracy of our disjunctions and those of single classifiers.

However, everyone has their niche
