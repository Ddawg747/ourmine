We've demonstrated the potential for large improvements in accuracy in exchange for a narrowing of potential classes. We've also presented a possible means for single-classification with HyperPipes that performs better than the original algorithm but not as well as Naive Bayes in the currently explored datasets. However, further analysis is needed to better ascertain what improvements can be had when MultiPipes is run on data with a larger space of classes or columns. Also, there is much to be done involving the combination of numeric and discrete attributes and whether better outlier detection can be achieved.
