% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:

% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file

% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide

\begin{abstract}

This paper explores classifiction with disjunctive sets using a modified form of HyperPipes~\cite{Eisenstein04} called MultiPipes. Rather than apply HyperPipes it's intended sparse datasets, we find that it's application to non-sparse, many-class datasets typically results in several tied classification scores which we then union into a disjunction. This union presents interesting possibilities in it's high accuracy in containing the target class. Although we initially cannot predict single classes, we find that these disjunctions often eliminate large portions of possible classes. Essentialy we aren't certain what the class is, but we are very certain of what the class is not. We also explore possible methods for addressing weaknesses that arise with disjunctive classification. We present two methods of reducing Mulitipipes' disjunctions to single classifications as well strategies that simply reduce the size of the disjunctions by avoiding overfitting. Finally, we consider the broader implications of disjunctive classification as a "triage" system where quick, online learning solutions are more useful than single classification.
