Due to the alpha value implementation MultiPipes can be set to return a larger subset with more accuracy or a smaller subset with less accuracy. This capability allows MultiPipes to be a very accurate narrower. This tied with the very fast performance of MultiPipes would allow for the implementation of a "triage" system in which MultiPipes would be used to eliminate some of the classes with a high accuracy. Also, since the alpha value only affects scoring the person using the narrower can choose between a smaller return set or higher accuracy without affecting how the information is subsequently learned. As an example of where this type of system would be helpful
