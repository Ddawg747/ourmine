=== Total Possible Runs ===
  2 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 3 = 144

=== Win/Loss/Tie Tables ===
  Compute averages for each run through the data.
  Compare each learner to each other for the same dataset.
    NaiveBayes is usually the benchmark.
    If a learner is 1.0 or more stddev faster, it gets a win, the one compared to it gets a loss.
      Otherwise, it's a tie.  Mark a tie for both.
  Make a table with this data:
    Each column is a FSS or Classifier, one table for each.
    Each row's header is the data table used.
    Each cell value is the average computational time.

=== Quartiles ===
    Make quartile charts with this data:
    Box and wisker chart.

=== Poster/Presentations ===
  Presentation will be roughly 15 minutes.
  Describe each one of our functions.
  Describe the performance of our functions.
  Describe the spread of our functions (quartiles).
