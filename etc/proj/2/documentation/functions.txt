Pre-Processor = sub-sample  
  During training, find the minority class and throw away instances (at 
  random) from the other classes till all classes have the same frequency.
  Use the learner trained on this sub-sample on the test data (without 
  sub-sampling)

Discretizer = bin-logging
  N-bins: Find max and min of each numeric columns. Replace number X with 
    round(N*(X - min)/(max-min)).
  Same as N-bins but "N" is set to the log of the number of unique values.

Clusterer = genic
  See gupta04_genic.pdf for explaination.

Feature Subset Selection = relief
  See 97kononenko_relief.pdf for explaination.
  See http://code.google.com/p/ourmine/wiki/Cs473proj2#Relief also.
  Useful attributes differentiate between instances from other class.
  Randomly pick some instances (here, 250).
  Find something similar, in an another class.
  Compute distance this one to the other one.
  Stochastic sampler: scales to large data sets.

Classifiers = naievebayes, twor
  See 95NM-GH-IHW-Develop_twor.pdf for explaination.
  See http://code.google.com/p/ourmine/wiki/Cs473proj2#Classifiers also.
