= Introduction =

I'm often asked how to a LISP IDE for home use. There are two answers, one quite long and one quite short:

 # The short answer: download and install x-windows, EMACS, SLIME, sbcl, and 100 add-ons to the above.
 # SSH in to any decent *NIX installation and use the tools already installed there.

Note that option 1 takes days and option 2 is instant. 

SSH-based EMACS can be quite powerful. For example, here is the EMACS screen I am working on right now, via SSH:

(If you want a bigger view, [http://ourmine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/share/img/screen-emacs.png click here].) 

Note that:
 *  Top-left I am running a UNIX shell (called using `M-x eshell`) so I can create directories, hunt for source code using `grep -R`, etc etc.
 *  Bottom-left I am running a LISP shell so I can interactively run my code.
 * And on the right I can edit LISP source code.

And, this being EMACS, I can divide the screen up any way I want to edit multiple files:

 * Cntl-X-2 splits the current buffer horizontally.
 * Cntl-X-3 splits the current buffer vertically.

Yes, you have to use ascii-based tools but get over it. Command keys are your friends. I've written and debugged very large and complex hunks of code this way- it really works quite well.

And just to add icing to the cake, there is a neat trick that allows you to use the mouse to jump around your emacs screen. Just add this to your `$HOME/.emacs` file:
{{{
(xterm-mouse-mode t)
}}}

So, before you spend days downloading and configuring your local machine, see if you can jump onto to a pre-configured on.
