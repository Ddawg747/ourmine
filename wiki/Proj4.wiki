Your mission is to report what works best. Please try to try a 5x5 cross-val of combinations of your pre-processors, clusterers, discretizers, FSSers, classifiers to see which geenrates most PDs and least PFs. Compare all results using the Mann-Whitney "winLossTie" script. 


To do

 * Run the 5x5 experiment
    * Note: you cannot do this one at the last minite since there may not be enough CPU between now and end of term to do all combos, 5x5.  Your task is the make the pragmatically best comparison, with full regard to the practical realities of such a large experiment. 
 * Make the output conform to the input of the WinLossTie scripts
 * Generate quartiles and win-loss-tie charts 
 * Generate a 3' by 4' landscape poster
    * Poster should co
    * Basement of library can print these; you can print non-gloss ($6) or full gloss ($12).
    * For test prints, A3 sheets are readable, and cheap to produce
    * For a sample poster, see http://ourmine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/share/pdf/poster.pdf
    * You can write this using
       - Latex (use "svn explort http://unbox.org/wisp/var/09/pom2/doc/ase09/poster/pom2poster/ poster" then run "make")
       - Powerpoint : layup one page in 5pt text. Won't look as good as the Latex, but some will find it easier.
       - Open Office, etc (see the Powerpoint advice)
    * Commit it somewhere in ourmine/branches/yourgroup/../etc/proj/4
 * Give a presentation (second week of December in class time)
    * Hand out gray scale A4 copies of your poster to the class (warning: so make sure your color scheme works well in gray scale).
    * Prepare "slides" contain just large versions of all the graphics in the posters.
    * In 15 minutes, walk us through the poster, showing the graphics on the overhead when appropriate
