 * Ability to run data mining evaluation experiments.
 * Ability to convert domain data into valid inputs for a learner;
 * Ability to describe the differences between widely-used data miners;

All students are required to join the GOOGLE news group [ http://groups.google.com/group/agent-oriented agent-oriented].
Official announcements will be posted to the thread [http://groups.google.com/group/agent-oriented/browse_thread/thread/d53c8ea98b2de9c8# admin]. Students are require to read these thread on a regular basis.

= Expected Workload =

You MUST be prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a week
to this class (excluding the time spent in the classroom). A minimal
prerequisite for the successful completion is good understanding
of programming concepts. You will be given class accounts on CS
Department machines and all assignments will have to be submitted
and run there. Please note that a Linux server can be accessed from
any PC using a secure connection service, such as SSH (explanation
to be provided in class).  

= Assessment =

Note: all reports to be in PDF using ACM conference "tighter" format http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

 * Monday week 4 : Intro exercises (10%)
 * Monday week 7 : Report on preliminary results (10 pages, 2 column), 20%
 * Monday week 10 : Progress report (10 pages, 2 column) 30%
 * Tuesday week 13 : Presentation of results (20 slides, using Google Docs), 10%
 * Monday week 15 : Final report (10 pages, 2 column), 25%

Note that students must complete one other 5% tasks, at any time, during the term. But this tasks must be completed by 
the middle of November:

 * Task 1: data mining studies, 5%


For special consideration on the above, either:

    * See me at start of semester advising planned absences or
    * provide a medical certificate indicating that the student was unable to work on their studies for a relevant period (that note need NOT name the illness, but should list its duration)

The code written for this subject can be quite complex. To run it and grade it, I often need project members present.
Therefore, for the coding projects, the code will be marked in _debrief_ sessions which all group members will attend:

 * Attendance is mandatory or you will score zero on that project (exception: medical  certificates).
 * Prior to the sessions, I will publish a calendar for students to fill in when they want to be graded. Students must negotiate amongst themselves for the available slots. *It is your responsibility, not mine, to adjust your other commitments so you can attend.*
 * At the start of each session, I will collect from each student one sealed unmarked envelope.
     * This envelope will contain the name of the student at the top, followed by a list of the group members.
     * Each group member (including the student) will be marked with the share of the  project grade that the student feel their peers deserve for that project. 
     * e.g. Tim=1, James=1, ObiWon=1 means that this student thinks that all students deserve equal marks. 
     * e.g. Tim=0.5, James=0.75, ObiWon=1 means that this student thinks ObiWon did most of the work, Tim worked half as much as ObiWon, and James worked somewhere in between.
     * e.g. Tim=0, James=1, ObiWon=1 means that this student believed that Tim should get zero marks for that project while James and ObiWon should get equal marks.
 * During those  sessions,  I will run the code and ask students questions about the code base. These questions will be asked on a round-robin basis (so all students will get an equal number of questions).
 * After the sessions, after the students have left, I will open the envelopes. 
 * The final mark for each student will be computed from:
   * The functionality seen during the session (was the project goal achieved); 
   * The answers the students gave to the questions (did each student demonstrate mastery of the techniques?); 
   * The contents of the envelopes (did all students work equally on the project?).


= Attendance policy =

Students are expected to regularly attend all lectures. After three noted absences, students will lose two points per absence. After three noted lated arrivals, students will lose one point per late arrival. If you have another commitment that requires you to be consistently late, you should drop the class.

= Social Justice Statement =

West Virginia University is committed to social justice. I concur with that commitment and expect to foster a nurturing learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. Our University does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, disability, veteran status, religion, sexual orientation, color or national origin. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in this class will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

If you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with Disability Services (293-6700).

= Statement of Academic Integrity =

The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course.

For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the Student Conduct Code at http://www.arc.wvu.edu/admissions/integrity.html. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter
