= Expected Workload =

You MUST be prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a week
to this class (excluding the time spent in the classroom). A minimal
prerequisite for the successful completion is good understanding
of programming concepts. You will be given class accounts on CS
Department machines and all assignments will have to be submitted
and run there. Please note that a Linux server can be accessed from
any PC using a secure connection service, such as SSH (explanation
to be provided in class).  

= Assessment =

Note: all reports to be in PDF using ACM conference "tighter" format http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

 * Monday week 4 : Intro exercises (10%)
 * Monday week 7 : Report on preliminary results (4 pages, 2 column), 20%
 * Monday week 10 : Progress report (8 pages, 2 column) 30%
 * Tuesday week 13 : Presentation of results (20 slides, using Google Docs), 10%
 * Monday week 15 : Final report (8 pages, 2 column), 30%

For special consideration on the above, either:

    * See me at start of semester advising planned absences or
    * provide a doctor's certificate indicating reasons for non-performance. 

= Attendance policy =

Students are expected to regularly attend all lectures. After three noted absences, students will lose two points per absence. After three noted lated arrivals, students will lose one point per late arrival. If you have another commitment that requires you to be consistently late, you should drop the class.

= Social Justice Statement =

West Virginia University is committted to social justice. I concur with that commitment and expect to foster a nurturing learning environment based upon open communication, mutual respect, and non-discrimination. Our University does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, age, disability, veteran status, religion, sexual orientation, color or national origin. Any suggestions as to how to further such a positive and open environment in this class will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

If you are a person with a disability and anticipate needing any type of accommodation in order to participate in this class, please advise me and make appropriate arrangements with Disability Services (293-6700).

= Statement of Academic Integrity =

The integrity of the classes offered by any academic institution solidifies the foundation of its mission and cannot be sacrificed to expediency, ignorance, or blatant fraud. Therefore, I will enforce rigorous standards of academic integrity in all aspects and assignments of this course.

For the detailed policy of West Virginia University regarding the definitions of acts considered to fall under academic dishonesty and possible ensuing sanctions, please see the Student Conduct Code at http://www.arc.wvu.edu/admissions/integrity.html. Should you have any questions about possibly improper research citations or references, or any other activity that may be interpreted as an attempt at academic dishonesty, please see me before the assignment is due to discuss the matter
