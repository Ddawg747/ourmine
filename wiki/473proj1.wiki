= Introduction =

In this project you will learn how to (very simple) data miners in LISP.


= Setup =

== Preliminaries ==
 * Get a gmail account.
 * Join the class google group : http://groups.google.com/group/csx73
 * Join the class repository by asking an administrator of that group to add you:
    * Tim Menzies 
    * Adam Nelson
    * Aaron Riesbeck
    * Zack Murray

== Downloads ==

 * Make room. Clean your CSEE account. The following download will consume up to 60M.
 * Find your ICCLE password (look for "googlecode.com password") in http://code.google.com/p/ourmine/source/checkou
 * Run these commands:

{{{
mkdir $HOME/svns
cd svns
svn checkout https://ourmine.googlecode.com/svn iccle --username your.gmail.user,name
}}}

== Uploads ==

 * Get a picture of yourself (less than 100KB) and add it to svns/ourmine/trunk/share/img 
 * Add that picture to the repository (_svn add svns/ourmine/trunk/share/img/MyPic.jpg_)
 * Commit those changes (_svn commit -m "my picture added"_).

== Create Your Group ==
 * Find some like-minded folks, form a group of three.
 * Get your group number (from me).
 * Create your own personnel page:  svns/ourmine/wiki/YourName  
 * With your group, add your group  page svns/ourmine/wiki/GroupNumber.

Most of your assignments will be submitted via the wiki (simplifies word processing).

Note that I do not list my email and neither should you (death to spammers). 

Since I belong to group zero, I also created the GroupZero page:
