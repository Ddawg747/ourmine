Remember of the old joke?

If you read the empirical SE literature, you can find a similiar "missing link" in current
descriptions of how to conduct empirical SE studies.
 * [#Easterbrook07 Selecting Empirical Methods for Software Engineering Research]:
  * 3 pages: research questions
  * 2 pages: differnt forms of "empirical truth"
  * 1 page: role of theory building
  * 9 pages: selecting methods
  * 1 page: data collection tecniques
  * 0 pages: data analysis (and then a miracle happens)
  * 2 pages: empirical validity
  *  1 page: conclusions

Speaking as a data mining reseracher, I'm here to say that selecting _data anaysis_ methods deserves more than 0 pages:

 * There are [http://promisedata.org/2010/ entire conferences] devoted to just "data analysis";
 * A detailed study of "data analysis" reveals:
   * Data analysis may never produce generalizable SE theories 
     * Shock! Horror!
     * (And if such generalizations exist, shouldn't we have found them by now?)
 * Methods of "data analysis" are close to methods of "control"
   * So "empirical methods" becomes "how to control a project".

= Why Aren't we Looking at PowerPoint? =

Like many before me, ([#Tufte05], [#Tufte06]),
I distrust PowerPoint:
 * PowerPoint is a tool for a one-way broadcast of completed ideas 
 * Knowledge diamonds;
 * Dressed to impress.

This format is faster to write.
 * Faster to hyperlink to refernces
 * You can write comments on this material, below.

Anwyway,  this talk comes from a different intellectual tradition:
 * Knowledge relativism
   * Using the hammer changes the hammer.

Seems inapprpriate to dress it up in PowerPoint
