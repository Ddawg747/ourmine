#summary For students of cs473, cs573, fall 2009.

= Preliminaries =
 * Get a gmail account.
 * Join the class google group : http://groups.google.com/group/csx73
 * Join the class repository by asking an administrator of that group to add you:
    * Tim Menzies 
    * Adam Nelson
    * Aaron Riesbeck
    * Zack Murray

= Downloads =
 * Edit $HOME/.bashrc and add the line
     * export SVN_EDITOR="`which nano` -m"
 * Make room. Clean your CSEE account. The following download will consume up to 135M.
 * Find your ICCLE password (look for "googlecode.com password") in http://code.google.com/p/ourmine/source/checkout
 * Run these commands:

{{{
mkdir $HOME/svns
cd svns
svn checkout https://ourmine.googlecode.com/svn ourmine --username your.gmail.user,name
}}}

(Warning: last year, this was a very slow process due to file server problems- which should be fixed.)

= Uploads =

 * Get a picture of yourself (less than 100KB) and add it to svns/ourmine/trunk/share/img 
 * Add that picture to the repository
       * svn add svns/ourmine/trunk/share/img/MyPic.jpg
 * Commit those changes 
       * svn commit -m "my picture added"

= Create Your Group =
 * Find some like-minded folks, form a group of three.
 * Get your group number (from me).
 * Create a branch for your work:
    * cd svns/ourmine; svn cp trunk/our branches/Number; svn commit -m "branch Number created"
 * Create your own personnel page:  svns/ourmine/wiki/YourName. Note that your picture is accessible at http://ourmine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/share/img/MyPic.jpg.
 * With your group, add your group  page svns/ourmine/wiki/GroupNumber.

Most of your assignments will be submitted via the wiki (this simplifies word processing). Note that the wiki pages are NOT in your branch but can be found in svns/ourmine/wiki. To edit pages, you can either:

 * create and edit them on-line (at http://code.google.com/p/ourmine/w/list)
 * or edit them on your local machine (at svns/ourmine/wiki/SomeNewPage) then commit the changes:
{{{
cd $HOME/svns/ourmine/wiki
Edit SomeNewPage.wiki
svn add SomeNewPage.wiki
svn commit -m "some new page"
}}}
Btw, the source of my [Timm] page is:

Note that I do not list my email and neither should you (death to spammers). 

Since I belong to group zero, I also created the GroupZero page:
