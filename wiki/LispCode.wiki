= The Big Picture =

== Development Structure ==

This code was written using a test-driven approach. i.e. whenever I built a new functionality, I wrote a _deftest_ command to test that code. 

{{{
(deftest test-normal ()
  (let ((n (make-normal)))
    (dolist (x '( 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1))
      (add n x))
    (check 
      (samep n "#S(NORMAL :MAX 5 :MIN 1 :N 9 :SUM 25 :SUMSQ 85)")
      (equal (mean n) (/ 25 9))
      (equal (stdev n) 1.3944334)
      (samep (format nil "~10,9f" (pdf n 5))  ".080357649")
    )))
}}}
This code throws a set of numbers at a normal distribution. If it is working correctly, then that distribution should generate certain values.

The above shows four _check_s. The _samep_ functions checks if two forms evaluate to the same print string, ignoring minor details like white space and capitalization.

A site effect of using _deftest_ is that a global _*tests*_ stores all the known tests and the _(tests)_ function can report what percent of the test suite is working right now.

It is impossible to understate the value of this kind of development. Everyday, I stop with a broken test. Every new day, I start with the test broken from last night. And if ever I make any changes to anything, I can check if that breaks anything else.

== Code structure ==

At the time of this writing, the main LISP directory is our/lib/lisp. This is broken down into:

 * [#miner.lisp our/lib/lisp/miner.lisp] : main load file. Loads the rest of the code.
 * [#tests our/lib/lisp/tests] : code for test suite
 * [#tricks our/lib/lisp/tricks] : general LISP utils
 * [#table our/lib/lisp/table] : code for storing data 
 * [#learn our/lib/lisp/learn] : code for learners 

This code structure will be discussed below.

== Getting Started ==

First, you have to [http://ourmine.googlecode.com install Ourmine]. Then
at the UNIX shell prompt:
{{{
cd ~/opt/our/lib/lisp
emacs
}}}
Once inside EMACS:
{{{
M-x slime
(load "miner.lisp")
}}}

== Data Structure ==

=== Main Data Structures ===

At the time of this writing, the main data structures are:

 * *eg* : an example data row
 * *header* : meta-information about each column of data (e.g. the maximum and minimum number seen in an row in a particular column). Headers have two sub-classes
   * *Discrete* : for non-numeric data
   * *Numeric*  : for numeric data
 * *table* : combines examples with column headers. 
 

For example, this code returns a _table_ with five _eg_s, one for each row of the data:

{{{
(defun did-you-play-golf ()
  (data
    :name   'weather
    :columns '( forecast temp humidity $wind play)
    :egs     '((sunny    hot  high     20    no) 
               (sunny    hot  high     10    no) 
               (sunny    hot  high     30    no) 
               (sunny    hot  high     20.2  yes)
               (sunny    hot  high     20.1  yes)
               (sunny    hot  high     20.7  yes)
              )
)
}}}

The table has four _discrete_ columns (forecast, temp, humidity, play) and one numeric one (denoted with a "$" sign: see"$wind"). The last column is the _class_ (so it  columns satisfies _header-classp_).  

Optionally, the columns can store frequency counts of the data seen in each column.  The code

{{{
(xindex (did-you-play-golf))
}}}
runs over the table and:
 * For _discrete_ columns, it stores the count of symbols seen in each class.
 * _Numeric_ columns are summarized,  assuming  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution normal distributions].


=== Other Structures ==

 * *normal* : used to store normal distributions and report mean, standard deviation, pdf, etc.
 * *caution* : collects any error strings on flaws found  when reading the data. If two many flaws are found, _caution_ calls an abort.

= The Details = 

== miner.lisp ==

This file defines a list of files to load; e.g. 
{{{
(defparamater *files* '(
                          "tests/deftest"
                          "tricks/lispfuns"
                          etc
                       ))
}}}
Once this file is loaded, then the whole system can be reloaded with _make_. 
{{{
(defun make (&optional (verbose nil))
  (if verbose
      (make1 *files*)
      (handler-bind 
          ((style-warning #'muffle-warning))
        (make1 *files*))))
}}}
Note that _make_ works in two modes. The call _(make)_ loads the system, suppressing SBCL's verbose load information. To see that output, use _(make t)_.
