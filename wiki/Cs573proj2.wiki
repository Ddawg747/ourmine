= Mission =

Your mission is to report either show the presence or prove the absence of a general theory of defect prediction, learned from the NASA (USA) and SoftLab (Turkey) data sets.

= Todo =

Referring to the [Cs473proj2] project, you should code up...

== Pre-processors ==

 #  the inputs and outputs shown in the [Cs47sproj2#Details Details] section.
 # a pre-processor that replaces numeric value _N_ with 
     * {{{log(N< 0.0001 ? 0.0001 : N)}}}
 # a pre-processor that builds a new "(data) call from N existing data sets
 # a pre-processor  that splits one "(data)" into 10 bins, then 
     * builds a train "(data)" from 90% of the data 
     * "(test)' data from 10% of the data.
     * Note that the distribution of classes in "train/test" should be similar to the original data set
 # a nearest-neighbor tool that finds the k-th nearest examples from example1 in some "(data)" set. For this you will need
     * A "normalizer" that reduces all numerics to min..max zero..one
     * A "bestK" tool
          * Given some performance measure (use "g") and N training examples remove 20 training instance (at random) then for k=1 to N-1 for a conclusion by polling the k-th nearest neighbors. Return the k value that maximizes the performance score. 

== Build Small Theories ==

For us to check of there is theory stability, it is wise to reduce the size of the training set (and so generate a small theory)

Methods for reducing the size of the data set (from http://menzies.us/pdf/08ceiling.pdf)
 # Sub-sample
     * During training, find the minority class and throw away instances (at random) from the other classes till all classes have the same frequency. Use the learner trained on this sub-sample on the test data (without sub-sampling). See [http://menzies.us/pdf/08ceiling.pdf Figure 3]. 
     * Special case: micro-sampling :
          * Select N defect classes at random. Select N nondefect classes at random
          * See results in [http://menzies.us/pdf/08ceiling.pdf section 3.2].
 # The Burak filter

You also need to hand-convert:
 * all the  arff files in http://unbox.org/wisp/trunk/ourmine/2.0/lib/arffs/softlab/
 * all the SHARED arff files into http://code.google.com/p/ourmine/source/browse/trunk/our/arffs/promise/ into our LISP format
