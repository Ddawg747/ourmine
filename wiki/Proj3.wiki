Experimental methods in data mining 10% 

Implement more functions:
  * One more pre-processor and FSS and discretization method (and you can repeat functions taken by other groups)
  * One more clusterer and  classifer NOT implemented by other groups.
  * Record you selected implementation at [http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqtLfKAJzgNrdEs0UnBXQm5WcWlIRDNMWWFiZWtNR2c&hl=en the usual place].

Run different combinations of pre-processor{{{*}}}discretizers{{{*}}}clusters{{{*}}}FSS{{{*}}}classifiers through at least 10 data sets (ranging easy to hard according to [http://code.google.com/p/ourmine/wiki/Cs473proj2#How_to_Pick_Test_Data the method I described before].

Run the results through the winLossTie script you've seen in class.

Commit all changes on-line (as per usual) and  also
  * Commit winLossTie results for all data (in one table) 
  * Commit winLossTie results for all datasets   individually.

Progress report (10 pages, 2 column) 30%.

Note: all reports to be in PDF using ACM conference [http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates "tighter" format].

Write down what we agreed in your demo2 sessions as your next task(s). 

Do those tasks, demonstrating significance progress towards a final report on the presence (or absence) on common patterns in defect prediction.
