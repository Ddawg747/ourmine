#summary intermediary data mining techniques

Due Monday week 7 

For this, and the next project, everyone has to code up

 * two pre-processors
 * two discretizers
 * two clusterers
 * two classifiers
 * two feature subset selectors.

Note that:

 * There are some magic numbers associated with each of the above  functions- assume three settings for each different data miners. 
 * Which you'll repeat 10 times;
 * Over 10 data sets
 * This means that, before the end of term, you'll have to run this code 10*10*3^5*2^5=777 combinations.
 * Tee hee!

Future projects will comparatively assess these 20,000+ possible data miners. This project will just get you started.

You will assume that there exists two files "train.lisp" and "test.lisp" containing data in the same format (same number of columns, and if a column is numeric/discrete in one, it is numeric/discrete in the other).

To run the code, your main function must be

{{{
(defun learn (&key (k            8)
                   (prep         #'normalizeNumerics)
                   (discretizer  #'10bins)
                   (cluster      #'(lambda (data) (kmeans k data)) 
                   (fss          #'infoGain)
                   (classify     #'naiveBayes)
                   (train        "train.lisp")
                   (test         "test.lisp"))
     ; first prep train and test
     ; then run the discretizer
     ; then cluster the training set into k clusters
     ; then train a classifier for each cluster
     ; then for all example in the test set
     ;     ... find the cluster with the nearest centroid...
     ;     ... classify that example  using that cluster's classifier
}}}
When you run the testing, you must keep four seperate counts, for each class in the test
set.


* A: the number of things  that are NOT class=A were NOT classified as class=A
* B: the number of things  that ARE class=A were NOT classified as class=A
* C: the number of things  that were

 


Your output must be comma seperated lines, one for each class in test set

prep,discretizer, cluster,fss,classify, class,a,b,c,d
