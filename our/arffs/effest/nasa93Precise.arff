%         J. Hihn and S. Stukes, Proceedings ICSE 2005,
%         http://menzies.us/pdf/04coconut.pdf
%         -- Results
%             -- Given background knowledge on 60 prior projects,
%                a new cost model can be tuned to local data using
%                as little as 20 new projects.
%             -- A very simple calibration method (COCONUT) can
%                achieve PRED(30)=7% or PRED(20)=50% (after 20 projects).
%                These are results seen in 30 repeats of an incremental
%                cross-validation study.
%             -- Two cost models are compared; one based on just
%                lines of code and one using over a dozen "effort
%                multipliers". Just using lines of code loses 10 to 20
%                PRED(N) points.

%         P02, P03, P04 are used in this paper.
%         -- Results
%             -- To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
%                of applying feature subset selection (FSS)
%                to software effort data.
%
%             -- FSS can dramatically improve cost estimation.
%
%             ---T-tests are applied to the results to demonstrate 
%                that always in our data sets, removing
%                attributes improves performance without increasing the
%                variance in model behavior.
%

% 4. Relevant Information
%
%    The COCOMO software cost model measures effort in calendar months
%    of 152 hours (and includes development and management hours).
%    COCOMO assumes that the effort grows more than linearly on
%    software size; i.e. months=a* KSLOC^b*c. Here, "a" and "b" are
%    domain-specific parameters; "KSLOC" is estimated directly or
%    computed from a function point analysis; and "c" is the product
%    of over a dozen "effort multipliers". I.e.
%
%    months=a*(KSLOC^b)*(EM1* EM2 * EM3 * ...)
%
%    The effort multipliers are as follows:
%
%     increase | acap | analysts capability
%     these to | pcap | programmers capability
%    decrease  | aexp | application experience
%      effort  | modp | modern programing practices
%              | tool | use of  software tools
%              | vexp | virtual machine experience
%              | lexp | language experience
%    ----------+------+---------------------------
%              | sced | schedule constraint
%    ----------+------+---------------------------
%     decrease | stor | main memory constraint
%     these to | data | data base size
%     decrease | time | time constraint for cpu
%       effort | turn | turnaround time
%              | virt | machine volatility
%              | cplx | process complexity
%              | rely | required software reliability
%
%    In COCOMO I, the exponent on KSLOC was a single value ranging from
%    1.05 to 1.2.  In COCOMO II, the exponent "b" was divided into a
%    constant, plus the sum of five "scale factors" which modeled
%    issues such as ``have we built this kind of system before?''.  The
%    COCOMO~II effort multipliers are similar but COCOMO~II dropped one
%    of the effort multiplier parameters; renamed some others; and
%    added a few more (for "required level of reuse", "multiple-site
%    development", and "schedule pressure").
%
%    The effort multipliers fall into three groups: those that are
%    positively correlated to more effort; those that are
%    negatively correlated to more effort; and a third group
%    containing just schedule information. In COCOMO~I, "sced" has a
%    U-shaped correlation to effort; i.e. giving programmers either
%    too much or too little time to develop a system can be
%    detrimental.
%
%    The numeric values of the effort multipliers are:
%
%      	        very				very	extra	productivity
%       	        low	low	nominal	high	high	high	range

%     The last column of the above table shows max(E)/min(EM) and shows
%     the overall effect of a single effort multiplier. For example,
%     increasing "acap" (analyst experience) from very low to very
%     high will most decrease effort while increasing "rely"
%     (required reliability) from very low to very high will most
%     increase effort.

%
%     The value of an effort predictor can be reported many ways
%     including MMRE and PRED(N).MMRE and PRED are computed from the
%     relative error, or RE, which is the relative size of the
%     difference between the actual and estimated value:
%    
%     RE.i = (estimate.i - actual.i) / (actual.i)
%
%     Given a data set of of size "D", a "Train"ing set of size
%     "(X=|Train|) <= D", and a "test" set of size "T=D-|Train|", then
%     the mean magnitude of the relative error, or MMRE, is the
%     percentage of the absolute values of the relative errors,
%     averaged over the "T" items in the "Test" set; i.e.
%
%     MRE.i  = abs(RE.i)
%     MMRE.i = 100/T*( MRE.1 + MRE.2 + ... + MRE.T)
%
%     PRED(N) reports the average percentage of estimates that were
%     within N% of the actual values:
%     
%     count=0
%     for(i=1;i<=T;i++) do if (MRE.i <= N/100) then count++ fi done
%     PRED(N) = 100/T * sum
%
%     For example, e.g. PRED(30)=50% means that half the estimates are
%     within 30% of the actual.  Shepperd and Schofield comment that
%     "MMRE is fairly conservative with a bias against overestimates
%     while Pred(25) will identify those prediction systems that are
%     generally accurate but occasionally wildly inaccurate".
